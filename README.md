# docker-devops-buildagent-vs2022
A docker buildagent for Azure Devops using Visual Studio 2022 community edition.

**Also disclaimer:** I take no credit for any of this apart from making a few tweaks and bringing the following sources together to get a working docker image. I take no responsibility for any issues/harm that arise from this so examine for yourself and use at own risk!
